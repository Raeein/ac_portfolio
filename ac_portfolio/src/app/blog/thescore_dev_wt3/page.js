                <p className="mb-6">
                  I spent the first couple of weeks starting where I had left
                  off previously, getting caught up to speed with the projects
                  that were on-going.
                </p>

                <p className="mb-6">
                  For the next couple of months, the team was going to be
                  working on a large feature aimed towards driving user
                  engagement and acquisition. The product scope was fairly large
                  as the work required was across various services. I had the
                  opportunity to partake in the planning meetings, which
                  included the breakdown of various stories into their
                  respective components.
                </p>

                <p className="mb-6">
                  During my time, I had the chance to work on new components and
                  features that taught me new development skills. In addition, I
                  started participating in code reviews where I had the chance
                  to understand new coding conventions and code quality
                </p>

                  Overall, the last four months have been filled with new
                  learnings and excitement. I had the opportunity to work on new
                  projects, allowing me tackle new problems and partake in more
                  leadership opportunities. Since this is the end of my first 4
                  months, I'm going to be continue working on the same project
                  for the same 4 months till the end of my term in August. Stay
                  tuned for more!
