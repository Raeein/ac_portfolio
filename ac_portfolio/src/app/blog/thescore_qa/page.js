                During my first work term, I was a QA Analyst on the Promotions
                team, working on theScore Bet. The journey was a great
                experience as I was surrounded by an amazing environment of
                positive and like-minded individuals, while having the
                opportunity to learn life long goals and skills.

                My Responsibilities
              </h3>
              <p className="mb-4">
                As a QA Analyst, my main focus was on the delivery of
                high-quality releases that satisfied product requirements to
                meet user expectations. Some of my work included the following:
              </p>
              <ul className="list-disc pl-6 mb-4">
                <li>
                  Created document test plans, test cases, and utilized
                  validation techniques for application functionality.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Participated in bug prioritizing, priority assessment, and
                  coverage tracking of reported bugs within the defect tracking
                  system.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Communicated with product, design, and executive teams through
                  reports to identify and solve quality issues.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <p className="mb-4">
                Similarly, other personal goals that I wanted to accomplish:
              </p>
              <ul className="list-disc pl-6 mb-4">
                <li>
                  Understanding other areas of software development, including
                  product, design and development teams across theScore
                  organization
                </li>
                <li>
                  Getting involved in people & culture life at theScore,
                  including co-op projects and volunteer opportunities
                </li>
              </ul>
              <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-4">April 2022</h3>
              <p className="mb-4">
                In April I came across an open position for a QA Analyst at
                theScore. It was extremely busy during this time as I was
                interviewing for several other companies as well as finishing
                the last of my exams for the school year. After applying, I was
                reached out a week later where I was offered two interviews. The
                interview process was smooth as I had the opportunity to
                demonstrate my skills. Later that day, I received a call where I
                was offered the position. The onboarding process was fairly
                quick as was I provided with the necessary equipment to start
                the following week.
              </p>
              <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-4">May 2022</h3>
              <p className="mb-4">
                During the first couple of days at theScore, there was a lot of
                information to cover during my onboarding, including documents,
                architecture, services, and different software tools. At first,
                it was overwhelming, however, everybody was extremely helpful
                which made learning a lot easier. I mainly spent the first
                couple of weeks playing around with the TSB app, as well as
                understanding the application for the promotions service.
              </p>
              <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-4">
                July 2022 - December 2022
              </h3>

              <p className="mb-4">
                For the next couple of months, I worked on different tickets for
                various products. I found it motivating to continue testing
                these new features knowing that they are used daily. July was a
                very successful month since it was the launch of theScore's
                in-house tech stack that enhanced markets and betting
                capabilities.
              </p>
              <p className="mb-4">
                Near the end of July, I had the opportunity to present a co-op
                project to the Sr. Leadership team, including the CEO, Directors
                and HR at theScore. Our project was a resource that would be
                used to target new employees that were interested in applying to
                theScore. We decided to create a prototype website to illustrate
                theScore's culture; theScoreStories which talks about theScore
                including individual stories from current co-op students.
              </p>
              <p className="mb-4">
                Fast forward to August, theScore had a special volunteer event
                with partnership with the Blue Jays Foundation. Alongside 100+
                theScore employees, we had the opportunity to host and lead many
                games and activities for athletes of all ages for the annual
                Challenger Baseball National Jamboree. December being the last
                month of the year meant for small releases in preparation for
                the holiday break and New Year. Looking back at the last several
                months, I had worked on a lot of interesting projects/products.
                Furthermore, I was able to achieve all of my learning goals.
                From signing off on tickets, to performing neccessary adhoc
                testing to watching these features come to life, it was an
                admirable experience.
              </p>
              <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-4">Conclusion</h3>

              <p className="mb-4">
                Working at theScore for my first co-op term was a great
                experience. I had the opportunity to learn a lot about the
                sports betting industry, including what the products and
                architecture were at theScore. Similarily, I learned a lot about
                quality assurance, performing quality testing, problem-solving,
                and identifying critical bugs within the workflow. Some of my
                favourite work included promotions feature work on the
                Viva/Vegas and Parlay+ launch. Both were very large milestones
                that took an all-around amazing effort across all teams within
                the organization.
              </p>

              <p className="mb-4">
                Although this is the end of my first work term, I will miss my
                colleagues and my time here working at theScore. However, I am
                excited about my future work terms as I want to continue
                expanding my skills and knowledge in software development.
